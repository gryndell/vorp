# Visual Operation Recording Program

This is a small experiment in recording of manufacturing operations. Data are
exchanged with an ERP system via JSON files. The program runs on a Raspberry Pi
or similar and is configured with a "Workstation ID". The ERP system is used to
assign individual jobs to workstations. Results of operations are returned to
the ERP system. Currently set up as partly bilingual, allowing field labels to
be in Thai script. JSON layouts were designed for exchange with QAD&trade;, but should
be applicable to other systems.
